## My Journey Making Games More Accessible

Ever since I created my League of Legends account in 2012, **Riot Games** has been more than just a game in my life—it has been the cornerstone of my gaming journey. The community around me naturally formed around League, and it was exhilarating to see how a game could foster friendships and a collective passion for competition.

Yet, I also noticed a recurring issue: not everyone found it easy to enjoy these games. Some of my friends, who hadn’t grown up playing MOBA or FPS titles, felt overwhelmed by steep learning curves and the high stakes of competition. It became clear that while the competitive core of these games is energizing, it can also be a barrier for newcomers.

## Turning a Question into a Career Path

I’ve always been intrigued by one central question: **How do we preserve the depth and competitive spirit of gaming while making it more inviting for new players?**

This curiosity guided me from my initial major in chemistry to pursuing **Computer Science**, where I gained the technical skills to address accessibility challenges in competitive gaming. During my studies, I applied this question to **Valorant**, conducting data analysis to help players better understand the game. I shared my findings in Reddit posts that resonated with the community, including:

These posts obtained **over 100,000 views and 100+ likes**, showcasing the community’s enthusiasm for data-driven insights. By presenting metrics like game length and tier-based performance trends, I aimed to **enhance players’ understanding** and help them improve their gameplay.

Additionally, I worked at a company where I conducted advanced **League of Legends** data analysis, contributing to the development of [**LOL.PS**](https://lol.ps), a platform designed to provide players with actionable insights to improve their performance. This experience deepened my understanding of player behavior and reinforced my passion for using data to empower players.

This passion for data analysis also led to a memorable experience at **AWS GameDay**, where I competed with a team of random participants I met on-site. Leveraging my analytical skills, I was able to solve complex challenges during the tournament, earning **3rd place**. Beyond the achievement, this experience highlighted the power of collaboration and adaptability, even in competitive environments.

Through these experiences, I’ve seen how combining **data-driven insights** with **meaningful communication** can empower players, foster collaboration, and build confidence in their gaming journeys.

## A New Direction: CS PhD in HCI

Through my observations of **Riot Games' titles**, I have identified three key challenges in modern gaming that I am passionate about addressing as I pursue my **Computer Science PhD with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):**

### **1. Sustainable Monetization Strategies**
Riot’s **TFT** successfully implemented gacha-based monetization, creating a model that appeals to players while generating revenue. However, **League of Legends** faces challenges with champion skins tied to specific characters among 170+ options, limiting their value for many players.

Building on my **game monetization research**, where I conducted a **thematic analysis** of games to identify monetization and retention patterns, I would love to explore innovative strategies for Riot. By analyzing player behavior and trends, I want to design systems that balance profitability with player satisfaction, ensuring purchases feel **meaningful and rewarding** for all players.

### **2. Improving Onboarding and Game UX**
For competitive games to thrive, they need to attract and retain new players. **League of Legends’** steep learning curve can deter beginners, questioning its long-term health. I aim to explore ways to simplify onboarding, from enhanced tutorials to adaptive UX, making the game more approachable and engaging for newcomers.

### **3. Building a Healthier Gaming Community**
Toxicity remains a significant issue in **League of Legends**, driving players away despite its compelling gameplay. My research will explore how in-game tools, community-driven initiatives, and AI moderation can foster a more positive, inclusive gaming environment, ensuring players feel supported and valued.

Through my PhD, I aim to leverage HCI methods to develop solutions that make games more profitable, accessible, and enjoyable for both new and veteran players, driving innovation at Riot Games.

## Looking Forward

Building on my experiences with game monetization, player behavior analysis, and fostering accessibility, I am excited to tackle challenges that shape the future of gaming. My passion lies in creating systems that support sustainable monetization, welcoming onboarding for new players, and healthier communities. 

Through my research and technical expertise, I hope to contribute to innovative solutions that enhance both player satisfaction and the long-term success of games.
